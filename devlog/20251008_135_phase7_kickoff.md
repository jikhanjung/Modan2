## Technical Approach

### 1. Load Testing Strategy

**Test Scenarios**:
```python
# Scenario 1: Many Objects, Few Landmarks
- 1000 objects × 10 landmarks
- 2000 objects × 10 landmarks
- 5000 objects × 5 landmarks

# Scenario 2: Few Objects, Many Landmarks
- 100 objects × 100 landmarks
- 50 objects × 200 landmarks
- 20 objects × 500 landmarks

# Scenario 3: Balanced
- 500 objects × 50 landmarks
- 1000 objects × 50 landmarks
- 2000 objects × 30 landmarks
```

**Metrics to Measure**:
- Analysis time (Procrustes, PCA, CVA, MANOVA)
- Memory usage (peak, average)
- Database query time
- UI responsiveness
- Import/export time

### 2. Memory Profiling Tools

**Tools**:

- `objgraph`: Object reference tracking
- Custom monitoring for Qt objects

**Focus Areas**:
- Landmark data storage
- Analysis result caching
- Image/3D model loading
- Qt widget lifecycle

### 3. UI Responsiveness Strategy

**Techniques**:

## Known Performance Issues (from Phase 4)

### Issue 1: CVA Performance Anomaly ⚠️
**Observation**: CVA slower with small datasets
- 10 objects: 0.131s
- 50 objects: 0.004s

**Hypothesis**: Overhead dominates for small N
**Investigation needed**: Profile CVA implementation

### Issue 2: MANOVA Small Dataset Bug ⚠️
**Observation**: MANOVA fails with < 10 objects
**Status**: Known limitation
**Fix needed**: Better error handling

### Issue 3: Variable Limit ⚠️
**Observation**: "Too many variables" warning
**Current**: Limiting to 20 variables
**Investigation needed**: Is this artificial limit necessary?
