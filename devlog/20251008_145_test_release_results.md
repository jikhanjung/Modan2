```bash
# Delete test tag locally
git tag -d v0.1.5-alpha.1-test

# Delete test tag remotely
git push --delete origin v0.1.5-alpha.1-test

# Delete GitHub release
# Go to: https://github.com/{username}/Modan2/releases
# Find "Modan2 v0.1.5-alpha.1-test"
# Click "Delete"
```

**Status**: Optional (can keep for reference)

#### 2. Document Success ✅ IN PROGRESS

- ✅ Test results documented (this file)
- [ ] Update Phase 8 progress report
- [ ] Commit test results documentation

#### 3. Prepare for Production Release ✅ READY

All systems validated and ready for production:
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline: Production-ready
- ✅ Build system: Production-ready
- ✅ Test system: Production-ready
- ✅ Release workflow: Production-ready

**Next**: Decide on production release timeline

### Short-term Actions (Days 3-4)

#### 1. Platform Testing (When Hardware Available)

**Windows**:
- Download and extract ZIP
- Run Modan2.exe
- Verify application launch
- Test core functionality

**macOS**:

- Integrate into documentation

**Priority**: High (improves user documentation)

### Medium-term Actions (Days 5-10)

#### 1. Production Release Preparation

**When ready for production release**:
```bash
# Option 1: Keep current version
git tag -a v0.1.5-alpha.1 -m "Modan2 v0.1.5-alpha.1 - Production Release"
git push origin v0.1.5-alpha.1

# Option 2: Bump to stable version
# Edit version.py: __version__ = "0.1.5"
git tag -a v0.1.5 -m "Modan2 v0.1.5 - Stable Release"
git push origin v0.1.5
```

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ CI/CD validated (DONE)
- ⏳ Screenshots added (optional)
- ⏳ Platform testing (optional)

#### 2. Code Signing (Future Enhancement)

**Benefits**:
