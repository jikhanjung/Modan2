## Installation and Usage (from Source)

Follow these instructions to run Modan2 from the source code.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Modan2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**For Linux users:** You also need to install system-level dependencies for Qt and other libraries.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 \
  libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 \
  libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-cursor0 \
  qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5widgets5
```

### 3. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Building from Source

This project uses `PyInstaller` to create standalone executables. A helper script, `build.py`, automates this process.

To create a distributable package for your operating system, run:

```bash
python build.py
```

The build artifacts will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Tests

The project is tested using `pytest`. To run the test suite, first install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r config/requirements-dev.txt
```

Then, run pytest from the project root:

```bash
pytest
```
