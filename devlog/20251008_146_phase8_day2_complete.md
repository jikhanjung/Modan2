# Keep as pre-release
git tag -a v0.1.5-alpha.1 -m "Modan2 v0.1.5-alpha.1 - Production Release"
git push origin v0.1.5-alpha.1
```

B. **Bump to Stable** (v0.1.5):
```bash
# Edit version.py: __version__ = "0.1.5"
git add version.py
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 0.1.5 for stable release"
git tag -a v0.1.5 -m "Modan2 v0.1.5 - Stable Release"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.5
```
