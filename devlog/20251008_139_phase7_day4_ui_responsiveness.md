### Identified Bottlenecks (Minor) ⚠️

**1. Landmark Unpacking** (71% of load time):
- Current: 382ms for 1000 objects
- Impact: Moderate (still well under target)

- Priority: **Low** (already fast enough)

**2. Dataset Creation** (24% of load time):
- Current: 127ms for 1000 objects
- Impact: Low (database writes)
- Optimization potential: Batch inserts

### No Critical Bottlenecks Found ✅

All operations complete well within acceptable time limits.

4. **No UI freezing expected**: All operations responsive

**Performance Expectations**:
- 100 objects: ~17ms ✅
- 1000 objects: ~540ms ✅
- 10,000 objects: ~5s (estimated) ✅
- 100,000 objects: ~50s (estimated) ⚠️ May want background loading

2. **Lazy unpacking**: Unpack landmarks on-demand
3. **Virtual scrolling**: For tables with 10k+ rows
4. **Batch operations**: Optimize database writes

**Priority**: **Low** - Current performance is excellent
