```

## Current Testing Status

### Existing Tests (530 total)

**Unit Tests** (~400 tests):
- ✅ MdStatistics: 95% coverage (PCA, CVA, MANOVA)
- ✅ MdUtils: 78% coverage (helpers, constants)
- ✅ MdModel: 56% coverage (database models)
- ⚠️ ModanController: Limited coverage
- ⚠️ ModanComponents: Minimal coverage
- ⚠️ ModanDialogs: Very limited coverage

**Integration Tests** (~50 tests):
- ✅ test_analysis_workflow.py (4 tests)
- ✅ test_import.py (12 tests)
- ✅ test_workflows.py (10 skipped - marked for expansion)
- ⚠️ Need more complete workflows

**UI Tests** (~20 tests):
- ✅ test_ui_basic.py (basic widget tests)
- ✅ test_ui_dialogs.py (7 skipped - need implementation)
- ⚠️ Need comprehensive dialog tests

**Performance Tests** (~10 tests):
- ⚠️ test_performance.py (marked as slow, skipped by default)
- ⚠️ Need proper benchmarking suite

### Testing Gaps

1. **UI Coverage**: Most dialogs lack comprehensive tests
2. **Integration**: Limited multi-component interaction tests
3. **Performance**: No established baselines or regression detection
4. **CI/CD**: Manual testing only, no automation
5. **Edge Cases**: Missing error handling and boundary tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Flaky UI Tests on CI**: Mitigation → Use xvfb, add retries, increase timeouts
- **Coverage Plateau**: Mitigation → Focus on high-value paths, accept lower UI glue coverage

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Regressions**: Mitigation → Establish baselines, alert on >10% degradation
- **CI Infrastructure Costs**: Mitigation → Use GitHub Actions free tier efficiently

### Low Risk
- **Test Maintenance Burden**: Mitigation → Focus on stable, high-value tests
- **Platform-Specific Issues**: Mitigation → Matrix testing catches early

## Dependencies

### External Services (Optional)
- **Codecov**: Coverage reporting and tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD infrastructure (free for public repos)
- **Benchmark Action**: Performance tracking over time

### System Requirements
```bash
# Linux (CI)
sudo apt-get install xvfb libxcb-* libglut-dev

# All platforms
Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
Qt5 libraries
OpenGL support
```
