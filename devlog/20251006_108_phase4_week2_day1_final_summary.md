## Technical Achievements

### Comprehensive Test Coverage Areas

**Geometric Operations**:
- ✅ Bookstein registration (2-point and 3-point baselines)
- ✅ Procrustes superimposition (2D and 3D)
- ✅ Rotation matrices (SVD-based Kabsch algorithm)
- ✅ Move operations (translation with None preservation)
- ✅ Rescale operations (including rescale_to_unitsize)
- ✅ 3D rotations (X, Y, Z axes)

**Missing Landmark Handling**:
- ✅ Imputation from reference shapes
- ✅ None value preservation through transformations
- ✅ Procrustes with incomplete data
- ✅ Object list validation

**Shape Analysis**:
- ✅ Centroid calculation (2D and 3D)
- ✅ Centroid size calculation
- ✅ Average shape computation
- ✅ Shape convergence detection
- ✅ Landmark counting (with/without missing)

### Issues Discovered and Documented

1. **align() Method Bug**: Uses `np.sqrt(1 - cos_theta**2)` which loses rotation direction
2. **Bookstein Coordinates**: Requires 3D coordinates internally, even for 2D datasets
3. **Grouping Variables**: Requires both variablename_list and propertyname_str
4. **Y-axis Rotation**: Convention differs from standard (documented in tests)

## Test Quality Metrics

### Best Practices
- ✅ Clear, descriptive docstrings for all tests
- ✅ One test, one assertion (mostly)
- ✅ Edge cases covered (None values, empty data, inconsistent data)
- ✅ Fixtures for database setup
- ✅ Proper variable naming
- ✅ Follows existing test patterns

### Performance
- 236 tests run in ~37 seconds
- No performance regressions
- Efficient database operations

## Coverage Analysis

### What Was Covered (+204 statements)
- Bookstein alignment workflow
- Procrustes superimposition algorithms
- Rotation matrix calculations
- Missing landmark operations
- Move and rescale transformations
- Centroid calculations
- Shape comparison and averaging
- Object list validation

### What Remains Uncovered (504 statements, 36%)

**Large Blocks**:
- File I/O operations (291-348, 548-731): ~180 statements
- Import/export functions (1751-1903): ~150 statements
- Resistant fit superimposition (1697-1748): ~50 statements
- align() 3D rotation branch (1099-1175): ~75 statements

**Why Not Covered**:
- File I/O: Complex, requires file system mocking
- Import/export: Large functions with many edge cases
- Resistant fit: Advanced algorithm, needs careful test data
- align() 3D: Requires specific baseline configurations

### Path to 70% (+6 percentage points, 89 statements)

**Option 1: Targeted Simple Operations** (~40 statements)
- Dataset refresh operations
- Object copy operations
- Simple is_float() tests
- Print/debug methods

**Option 2: Focus on One Major Area** (~75-150 statements)
- align() 3D rotation branch
- OR subset of import/export functions
- OR file operations with mocking

**Recommendation**: Combine Option 1 + partial Option 2 for next session

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Incrementally**: Add tests in small batches, run frequently
2. **Check Coverage Impact**: Some tests cover already-tested lines
3. **Read Source Carefully**: API signatures and conventions matter
4. **Document Bugs**: Found align() rotation direction issue
5. **Edge Cases First**: None values, empty data, inconsistent counts
6. **Coordinate Systems**: 2D vs 3D handling is nuanced

## Session Statistics

### Work Completed
- **Duration**: Extended session
- **Commits**: 4 successful commits
- **Tests Added**: 36 comprehensive tests
- **Test Classes**: 10 new test classes
- **Coverage Gain**: +15 percentage points
- **All Tests**: 236 passing, 0 failing

### Code Quality
- ✅ All linting checks pass (ruff)
- ✅ All formatting checks pass
- ✅ No regressions
- ✅ Clean commit history
- ✅ Detailed commit messages

## Next Steps

### Day 2 Plan (To Reach 70%)
1. **Add simple operation tests** (20-30 statements):
   - Object refresh
   - Dataset operations
   - Utility methods

2. **Add align() 3D tests** (30-40 statements):
   - 3D baseline alignment
   - 3-point baseline rotation

3. **Target**: 70%+ coverage (140 statements to add)

### Alternative: Accept 64% as Milestone
- Achieved 91% of original 70% target
- Covered all critical algorithms (Procrustes, Bookstein)
- Remaining gaps are complex I/O operations
- Quality over quantity approach
